        <p>An investigation and re-telling of the simple orgins of our tale ...
            <br>
            <br>
        To keep it short and sweet; at the ripe age of 30 after near enough a decade in London  I acknowldged my life was not serving me and I wanted something different for myself. 
            Self-assured I wouldn't loose those who matter to me I gave my notice on my job and accommodation, packed my life into a van a moved home with a four month plan to study for a career change, learn to drive and buy a house.
            Little did I know that not a week into my 'next chapter' a plot twist would came thick and fast. 
            <br>
            <br>
            At a sports themed birthday up north a 7 year old was whipping my a** and my competitve nature lead to a partially torn ACL and damaged MCL.
            It was a blessing in disguise ... like we're talking deep cover, I'd left London to slow down and the universe had heard me loud and clear. I compeleted a Agile Project Management course as planned while in a brace and crutches and while informative it did not spark the joy I was hoping for.
            Back to the drawing board aka ChatGPT. After a soulful deep dive Coding and Cyber Security kept popping up, I'd dabbled in coding for the last year ish and my impression of Cyber Security was deeply rooted in a terminator style 'I'll be back'. 
            So while feeling flat doom scrolling instagram later that night I came across an advert for Level 2 government funded course in Cyber Secuirty. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I can take a hint. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I read up on it and decided not making a decsion was getting me nowhere. So I took the leap, entirely metaphorically as I couldn't walk.
            After an eye opening 2 weeks I found myself juggling youtubes between ethical hacking, python basics and Grace Hopper's lost lecture, opening a GitHub account and listening to cyberwire daily.
            <br>
            <br>
            I may never be the best cyber security professionl to ever exist or even a notable one but if I can make a positive difference, love every second of developing my skills and knowledge and enjoy my job even a fraction as much as I enjoy seeing the world behind the GUI then that'll do pig. That'll do. </p>
